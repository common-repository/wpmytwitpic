== Description ==

wpMyTwitPic takes a twitter users images that have been uploaded to the TwitPic service and displays a custom number of them on a page.

The admin options require a valid twitter username and an integer to define the number of pictures to display.

You can define which page to display the images on by publishing a page with [wpMyTwitPic] in its body.  Other text may also be placed above and
under the [wpMyTwitPic] tag.  It is suggested that a line break (carrige return) should be placed before and after the tag if any other text is 
to be used.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wpMyTwitPic.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/wpMyTwitPic/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

It is suggested that you install this plugin via the WordPress Add New Plugin page rather than by uploading the files manually.
